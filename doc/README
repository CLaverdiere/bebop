# Building

Build the compiler:
  $ make

Build executable from source file source.bb:
  $ make source.out

To run all tests, placing executables in the tests/ directory, objects in bin/
and assembly in asm/:
  $ make tests

# Directory Structure

asm/   : Generated assembly
bin/   : Binary / Object files
doc/   : Documentation
src/   : Source files
tests/ : Tests

# Coding style:

This compiler is a hybrid of C and C++. I attempt to use C++ only where needed
to prevent the code from becoming unmanagable. C is just more fun.
